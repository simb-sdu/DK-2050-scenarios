2035 and 2050 based on energy scenarios from the danish energy agency.
[1] gives detailed information of fuel types used for heat (and electricity) production, however the total consumption is given in capacities (ME) and not in energy (PJ).
A related study [2] gives electricity and districtheat use in PJ, and is based on the same data, hence data form the two sources are combined.
As [2] gives no information on PJ used of individual heating, and [1] only gives the capacity, we assume the following proxy to determine PJ of individual heating: capacity_DH / energy_DH = capacity_IH / energy_IH. i.e., we assume the same ratio between capacity and energy consumption, and isolate the formula to determine energy of individual heating.

combined district heat from gasses, residual heats from industry, etc to simplify mix.
assumed inventories rom ecoinvent.

scaled up a 10 kW heat pump to a 250 kW high temperature heat pump, used inventories from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2023.06.016
heat from waste and residuals asumed burden-free in accordance with the cut-off system model.
infrastructure (isolated heat pipes) was not included in ecoinvent, and is hence not included in our assumptions.
district heat distribution losses assumed constant from 2020 (distribution 20% loss)
