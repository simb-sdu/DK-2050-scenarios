2035 and 2050 based on energy scenarios from the danish energy agency.

combined district heat from gasses, residual heats from industry, etc to simplify mix.
assumed inventories rom ecoinvent.

scaled up a 10 kW heat pump to a 250 kW high temperature heat pump, used inventories from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2023.06.016
heat from waste and residuals asumed burden-free in accordance with the cut-off system model.
infrastructure (isolated heat pipes) was not included in ecoinvent, and is hence not included in our assumptions.
district heat distribution losses assumed constant from 2020 (distribution 20% loss)
